# tiktok-download-userscript
Browser userscripts to download TikTok videos without watermark and get livestream URLs (to play in VLC).

# News

Tiktok has changed something in their backend and we're currenly unable to get watermarkless videos for anything uploaded afer July 27th 2020. I'm looking into it. Older videos can still be downloaded without watermark.

# Installation
Install a userscript manager:

  * [Greasemonkey (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
  * [Tampermonkey (Chrome/Chromium)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)

Install these as you wish:

  * [Video Download](https://github.com/Zipdox/tiktok-download-userscript/raw/master/tiktok-dl.user.js)
  * [Stream Link Extractor](https://github.com/Zipdox/tiktok-download-userscript/raw/master/tiktok-stream.user.js)

# Video Downloader Usage
A download button will appear next to the other share buttons when viewing a post:
